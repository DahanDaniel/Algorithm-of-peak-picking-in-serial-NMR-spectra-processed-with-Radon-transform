# Algorithm-of-peak-picking-in-serial-NMR-spectra-processed-with-Radon-transform
This is a project that's part of my bachelor's thesis.

There are two publications describing the idea behind Radon transform for analysing peaks in NMR specra. The file 'Rclean1' is a problem simulation and the file 'PeakPicker2' is code implementation into real data, which is stored in the 'Data' folder.
